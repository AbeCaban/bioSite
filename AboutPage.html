            <article id="AboutContent">She is a really happy person all around. She enjoys 
            life and the little things also in the big things. She lives in the moment I would say 90% of the time which 
            makes her really grounded to her surroundings. She's a really determined person when it comes to 
            acquiring new knowledge on things she likes like reading from your favorite authors or reading about 
            space travel or new puzzles. She really loves her family dearly and feels for them intensely. Her sister her 
            is her best friend which she gives a lot of kisses and hugs although her sister doesn't like being touched 
            much. Another thing she really likes is pets. She has had multiple pets throughout her life. There has 
            been dogs , fishes and cats. I asked her how would she feel about leaving without pets and she says it's 
            out of the question or she sees it not happening. Right now she has two cats which she loves dearly. one 
            thing she also liked is to have plants around the house and also take care of them. She also likes the idea 
            of having a homemade garden that gives fruits or vegetables that she can cook freshly from her garden. 
            She was born in Puerto Rico in the Pueblo of Toa Baja. Like that community because it was a syncopal 
            community and one can just walk to either her uncles and aunts house, also her grandma's house and 
            whenever she was growing up it was easily a way to play with other kids because did did not live very 
            far. She also likes all types of music but not all types of artists.</article>
