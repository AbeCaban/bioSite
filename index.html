                <p id="TravelCarAccomp">My major accomplishment was the few travels I did in 2022. I went to states that I haven't been to, 
                    discover new places like Tennessee, Delaware, North Carolina, Long Island New York, New York City, 
                    New Jersey and Philadelphia. and I also got to see the Artemis 1 launch.</p>

                <p id="GradGirlAccomp">I felt like I could come accomplished the first step on a whole new stage of my life but just the first step 
                    and that I was ready to build upon it whether with my career or more location further on.</p>

                <p id="ShygirlAccomp">I've had many accomplishments minor ones but one that I'm proud is when I got over my shyness about 
                    talking to strangers that was accomplished while I was working in universal because I was trained on it 
                    and I had coaching and it made me be a more secure person and trust my instinct when talking to 
                    strangers it is still hard but I'm glad I overcame that anxiety.</p>
